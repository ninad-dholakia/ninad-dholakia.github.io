As moonlight fondles your face
I envy all the rays lit bright
The radiance that gets to feel your grace
How fulfilled the moon must feel at this sight!

As light reveals more of you, time slows and i dream
Of all my desires being met as I pace
Into your eyes as they draw me in
Only to be pierced by their stirring gaze.

But as i near your moonlit self, it dawns upon me
You too have a dream, but not me in it.
